# Patrick White

Hey! I'm Patrick! (He/Him) I'm a former musician now working as a Web Developer. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an app to host a sandwich competition for a whatsapp group (...don't ask), and also a guitar tuner.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about TypeScript and Go.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything really! I just want to keep learning and meeting new people in the industry so please get in touch here or on twitter (@patrickcfwhite).

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with the overlap between JS and Music/creative applications of coding.

- 💬 Ask me about anything wedding related haha. I've played at about 300 weddings, I have all the top tips if you're getting married or need a band! That or JavaScript...

- ⚡ Fun fact: I've played at The Royal Albert Hall, Birmingham Symphony Hall, Leeds&Reading *AND* queued in Tesco behind Dave Grohl.
